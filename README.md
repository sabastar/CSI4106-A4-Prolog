# CSI4106-A4-Prolog

Purpose: to experiment with first order logic and PROLOG

Q1: Given knowledge base of travel info write a PROLOG program that will determine:

  1) Whether it is possible to travel from one place to antoher by 'chaining together' car, train, and plane journeys. For example, travel(valmont, raglan). The answer will be true or false.
  2) How to exactly get from one place to another in terms of cities i.e. which cities to go through
  3) How to exactly get from one place to another in terms of what form of transportation
  
  Expand PROLOG programs to experiment with only using car and train for travel. Make any reasonable assumptions as needed, but state them clearly.

Q2: Given a maze

  a) Create an appropriate knowledge representation
  b) Creates a query that answers the question whether you can get from node 2 to 3
  c) Create a query that answers which nodes are reachable when you start from 1
  d) Create a query that answers which nodes have some path to 9
